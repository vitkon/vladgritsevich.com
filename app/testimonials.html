                    I cannot say enough wonderful things about Vlad! From our initial communication to the finished product, he exceeded our expectations. He has completed three very different projects for us. He reupholstered our ottoman, and gave suggestions that really gave the piece new life Additionally, he used the extra fabric to make corresponding throw pillows too. He also made a cornice from just a picture I sent him. I came out fabulous! No detail was overlooked, from the trim to edges that aren’t typically seen, it was all done with precision. He is willing to go the extra mile, and won’t consider it done until both we and himself are happy. He is truly and artist and a perfectionist. In a world where it seems hard to find personal attention anymore, he is definitely the exception! He goes above and beyond.

                    Vlad’s work is amazing. It was clear early on that he is a true artist — in the way he appreciates fabric and gets it to ‘sing’ for him, his deep understanding of carpentry, but most, for his eye for detail and line. He’s a true Couch Whisperer! On the professional side, his prices are fair, his communication is constant and clear, and he’s true to his word. Trust his vision — you’ll be absolutely pleased.

                    Vlad created an upholstered headboard for my daughter from a picture I had sent him. He literally made the headboard completely from scratch. He came over and measured her existing bed, figured out how to dismantle the headboard piece which was attached to the bed and then went back, made the form, brought THAT back over to my house, and then created this amazingly gorgeous upholstered headboard with beautiful nailheads in a matter of days. The craftsmanship of this piece is unparalleled. Not only did he create the piece EXACTLY as I wanted it, but he came over 3 times to figure out how to construct it so that it would attach perfectly to her (boring) old bed. When he was finished, he came over and the headboard fit PERFECTLY onto the bed frame. The price was also reasonable. I am currently having him work on another project already. I have had so many compliments on the piece already!! I plan on using Vlad for years to come.

                    Vlad is a true artisan. He recently reupholstered and stabilized an old rocking chair for me. He replaced the worn, shabby material with a rich burgundy leather. The finished product turned out beautiful! His knowledge and attention to detail is impeccable. Vlad loves what he does and takes pride in his work — and it shows. I highly recommend him for any furniture reupholstery job, big or small.

                    Vlad reupholstered 2 very beat up couches that needed lots of TLC. He is an absolute master. He thought through the placement of every single thing. The work is simply gorgeous. He is absolutely lovely to work with. I can’t possible say enough about how thrilled I am with ihim and to see and use those pieces. They are the nicest in the house.

                    Vlad had to rebuild the structure of our couch built in 1917 even before he could reupholster it. The work is nothing short of magnificent. The same is true of 2 chairs he reupholstered for us. His work is beyond compare. Not only has he mastered his craft he has impeccible client skills.

                    Vlad is a true craftsman. He has done a number of projects for us, including: Reupholstering and restoring 2 sitting chairs, redesigning and reupholstering a sofa, 10 antique dining room chairs and even custom pillows and a quilt. In every project Vlad was a perfectionist and delivered beyond our expectations. The workmanship has impressed every person who has seen it. And we enjoy Vlad’s work throughout the house on a daily basis.

                    Vlad’s professionalism is reflected not only in the quality and attention to detail of the finished product, but also the ability to work closely with clients at every step of the process to ensure complete satisfaction. From choosing the fabric, to finishing touches, Vlad was there guiding us through numerous choices and decisions, making the process stress-free. We love our dining set, and enjoyed the creative experience. We look forward to working with Vlad again on future projects in our house.

                    EXCELLENT JOB. Precise, very defined in doing the very best in creativity design and making an old piece look like brand spanking new. A true artist there is no other person like Vlad!! Who can be so detailed and almost fanatical about doing the very best!!! He is a true artist with a blessed talent. Roberta

                    Vlad was referred by a friend and did an AMAZING job on our dining room chairs. We emailed photos of the chairs we wanted recovered and he quickly responded with a price and the amount of fabric we needed to purchase. I could not be happier with his professionalism and quality of work.
